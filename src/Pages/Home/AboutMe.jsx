                        Hello! I am Alyssa Ingerson and I recently graduated from the Virginia Military Institute with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a track in Theory and Application. During my academic career and 6 months of internship experience, I developed valuable skills in a variety of fundamental computer science topics such as algorithms, data structures, software development, software testing, and programming languages. I am familiar with various languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. I also have experience with database management systems such as MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero-section-description">
                        I became more passionate about software development while working on my senior capstone project, where my team and I designed and developed a gamified web application for K-12 students and educators. This project was very rewarding and taught me so much about full stack development. I can't wait to learn even more! 
                    </p>

                        When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy running and playing the piano!
